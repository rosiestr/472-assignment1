### Part 1: Dataset Preparation and Analysis

<ol>
  <li>Step 1: Open the Jupyter notebook called "1.Prep_and_Analysis.ipynb"<\li>
  <li>Step 2: Run the first code block to import all the required libraries
  <li>Step 3: In the second code block, replace the file directory with the full path on your computer to the goemotions.json.gz dataset<\li>
  <li>Step 4: Run the second block of code to load the dataset<\li>
  <li>Step 5: Run the third code block to display the pie chart of the emotions<\li>
  <li>Step 6:Run the fourth code block to display the pie chart of the sentiments<\li>
 <\ol>


### Part 2: Dataset Preparation and Analysis

<ol>
  <li>Step 1: Open the Jupyter notebook called "2_words_as_features.ipynb"<\li>
  <li>Step 2: In the first code block, replace the file directory with the full path on your computer to the goemotions.json.gz dataset<\li>
  <li>Step 3: Run the first code block to important necessary libraries and load the dataset<\li>
  <li>Step 4: Run the second block of code to load the dataset, which creates the countvectorizer and fits the data<\li>
  <li>Step 5: Run the third code block to get the training data. Note: In this step you will need to comment and uncomment the line you want to run, so either emotions or sentiments. Only one line can be uncommented, by default it will run with sentiments<\li>
  <li>Step 6:Run the fourth code block to train and test the Base-MNB model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 7:Run the fifth code block to train and test the Base-DT model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 8:Run the sixth code block to train and test the Base-MLP model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 9:Run the seventh code block to train and test the Top-MNB model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 10:Run the eigth code block to train and test the Top-DT model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 11:Run the ninth code block to train and test the Top-MLP model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 12:Go back and Run the third code block to get the training data for the set that you had commented. So comment out the current training data, and uncomment the one that was commented.<\li>
  <li>Step 13:Run the tenth code block to train and test the Base-DT model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 14:Run the eleventh code block to train and test the Base-MLP model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 15:Run the twelfth code block to train and test the Top-MNB model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 16:Run the thirteenth code block to train and test the Top-DT model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 17:Run the fourteenth code block to train and test the Top-MLP model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 18:Run the fifteenth code block to train and test the Base-MNB model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 19:Run the sixteenth code block to train and test the Base-DT model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 20:Run the seveneteenth code block to train and test the Base-MLP model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 21:Run the eigteenth code block to train and test the Top-MNB model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 22:Run the nineteenth code block to train and test the Top-DT model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 23:Run the twentith code block to train and test the Top-MLP model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
  <li>Step 24:Run the twentith code block to train and test the Top-MLP model with our data, and display the score.<\li>
